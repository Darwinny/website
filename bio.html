<p id="bio" >Hollywood Series 2016. <br>
<br>
What does Hollywood mean to each of us? An aspiration? Entertainment as an escape? Is it the ideal? Is it a shadow of our lives? Are the movies and shows the stories that give definition to our chaotic lives? Who are these people that we know and don't know? Our attention means big money for them, but what do these familiar faces really mean to us? <br><br>

None of the paintings in my Hollywood series is of any particular actor or actress; they are compilations of their roles in movies and shows. Many include people in my own life mixed in. In the end, they are humans whom we respond to with our own ideas and associations. <br><br>

My portrait series in 2010 of 18 of close friends and family members was an intense experience and that series is echoed in this series. I'm not going for photo real or for the kind of portrait that would hang in a bank or board room. Sitters knew the outcome would be weird and not resemble them at all in a classic representational way. My paintings are responses to what I see and how I see it, not to what I think I should see or hope to see, or what the sitter wants or hopes to see. My 100 Broken Shell series was a metaphorical exploration into our brokenness as people. We know the Hollywoods have their ups and downs, just as we all do. We watch and pay to see that as well. <br><br>

This series is my portraits and my broken shells and my associations mixed together, hopefully capturing the cool, the appeal, some tenderness, some humanity, some intensity, some spark that asks why or maybe even answers the why. <br><br>

Thank you.<br><br>
